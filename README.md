# Main gas pipelines calculations

A program for thermal and hydraulic calculation of a gas pipeline section between 
two compressor stations of a main gas pipeline is presented.  
The purpose of the calculation is to determine the pressure and temperature of the gas at the end of the section.  
The calculations are performed according to the theory that is presented in Bykov's handbook [[1]](#1).  
See [documentation](https://main-gas-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/v0.0.2).  
[main-gas-pipeline](https://github.com/Buzovskiy/main-gas-pipeline/releases/tag/v0.0.2) on github.

## Install
```
pip install main-gas-pipeline==0.0.2
```
See [examples](https://github.com/Buzovskiy/main-gas-pipeline/tree/master/examples) of using the package.
